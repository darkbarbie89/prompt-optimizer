## Documentation Merge Summary

To improve organization and readability, the project documentation has been restructured and merged as follows:

| technical-development-guide.md | development-guidelines.md, technical-documentation.md | Technical development guide combining standards and tech docs |
| project-structure.md | file-structure.md, fileNames.md | Project structure including file and directory organization |
| project-status.md | progress.md, chrome-extension-plan.md | Project status with progress and Chrome extension plans |

## Core Documents

- README.md – Project overview
- technical-development-guide.md – Technical stack and development standards
- project-structure.md – File and directory organization

## Documentation Maintenance

1. All docs use Markdown format
2. Add update dates at the end of each doc when changed

4. Code examples must be runnable and follow project standards
5. Avoid duplicate content across different documents
6. Deprecated docs should be marked and point to replacements
